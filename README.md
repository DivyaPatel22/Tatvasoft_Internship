# Internship – Summer 2025 | TatvaSoft
A 15-day internship portfolio exploring modern web development with Angular, .NET, and PostgreSQL—featuring daily hands-on projects, backend integration, and data-driven solutions.

This repository contains the full-stack web application developed during my **15-day Online Summer Internship at TatvaSoft**, as part of the structured training plan focused on practical, task-based learning.

📚 Internship Overview

- Duration : 15 days  
- Company : TatvaSoft  
- Mode : Online 
- Daily Structure :
     Morning Session – Concept exploration and hands-on assignments
     Noon Evaluation – Progress review and feedback
     Doubt Clearing Session – Problem-solving and Q&A
The internship emphasized hands-on implementation of various frontend, backend, and database functionalities through guided tasks. All features in this project were developed by following daily objectives assigned during training.

🔨 Project Objective - 
The goal of this project was to build a fully functional full-stack web application using Angular (Frontend), .NET Core (Backend), and PostgreSQL (Database). Each day introduced new concepts and incremental tasks to build up the system.

📅 Daily Breakdown & Features Implemented :

  Day 1: Set up PostgreSQL database with schema, CRUD operations, and sub-queries.
  Day 2: Created a basic Angular application using forms and components.
  Day 3: Set up .NET backend with EF Core and built login API using LINQ.
  Day 4: Implemented authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
  Day 5: Performed user CRUD operations with LINQ-based data retrieval.
  Day 6: Built mission and theme CRUD functionality with full UI integration.
  Day 7: Added mission skill management and displayed missions on user dashboard.
  Day 8: Enabled users to apply for missions with API integration and search features.
  Day 9: Created profile management page and learned deployment strategies.
  Day 10: Explored AWS basics and deployment practices for cloud readiness.

🛠️ Tech Stack

⚙️ Setup Instructions 

1. Clone the repository :
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/internship-project-2025.git
2. Backend (.NET) :
       dotnet restore
       dotnet run
3. Frontend (Angular) :
       npm install
       ng serve
4. Database Setup :
       PostgreSQL installation
       Apply migrations
       Configure connection string in appsettings.json

🧠Key Learning Outcomes :
    - Practical full-stack integration and API development
    - Database schema evolution and LINQ querying
    - Form validation, authentication flows, and RBAC
    - Deployment mindset and platform readiness
This internship helped me strengthen my problem-solving and debugging skills by dealing with real-time frontend/backend integration, common issues like CORS errors, form state management, and CRUD operations.

📝 Project Summary:
          As part of a structured 15-day virtual internship at TatvaSoft, this project was developed to explore full-stack web development. Mission is a task-driven platform designed to simulate employee participation in community missions—a core component of CSR engagement programs.
Using Angular, .NET Core, and PostgreSQL, the platform guides users through features like user registration, mission creation, mission applications, and skill mapping. The backend handles robust API communication with LINQ and EF Core, while the frontend offers a clean and responsive user experience.
Key features include:
  - CRUD functionality for users, missions, themes, and skills
  - Role-based access for Admin and User portals
  - Mission filtering, sorting, and application tracking
  - Profile management and basic deployment readiness
